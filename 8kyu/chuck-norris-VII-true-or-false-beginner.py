# Details
    It's a well known fact that anything Chuck Norris wants, he gets. As a result Chuck very rarely has
    to use the word false. It is a less well known fact that if something is true, and Chuck doesn't want
    it to be, Chuck can scare the truth with his massive biceps, and it automatically becomes false.
    Your task is to be more like Chuck (ha! good luck!). You must return false without ever actually
    using the word false... Go show some truth who's boss!

# Exemplu 1
def ifChuckSaysSo():
    return not True

# Exemplu 2
def ifChuckSaysSo():
    return 1 is 2
