# Details
    Complete the square sum function so that it squares each number passed into it and then sums the
    results together. For example, for [1, 2, 2] it should return 9 because 1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 9.

    ([1,2]), 'squareSum did not return a value')

# Exemplu 1
def square_sum(numbers):
    res = 0
    for num in numbers:
        res = res + num*num
    return res
